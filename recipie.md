1) Pour the sweetened condensed milk in a pie dish.
2) Place the pie dish in a large roasting pan and place the roasting pan in the oven.
3) Fill the roasting pan with enough HOT water until it reaches halfway up the pie dish. This is exactly what we do when we bake cheesecake.
4) Loosely cover the pie dish with aluminum foil.
5) Heat oven to 350°F (177°C).
6) Bake until sweetened condensed milk has thickened and caramelized, about 2 hours. Add more hot water after 1 hour, since some of it has evaporated.
7) All of the “work” is hands-off. After 2 hours, the sweetened condensed milk has turned into golden dulce de leche. Magic. Let the dulce de leche cool, then pour into your pre-baked graham cracker crust. You can make the dulce de leche up to 2 weeks in advance
